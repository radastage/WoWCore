# WoWCore
WoWCore Server (Personalization)

•Many upgrades (and possibly downgrades) between the original RomanRom2 and this fork;

•I want to say thanks to RomanRom2 for making this project, since I've been using it for years for now, even in artistical ways, such as making screenshots, writing stories etc, and for practice;

•After these years I wanted to share the code for unknown purposes, and one last thing I must say: do what you love to do, because you never know what effect and impact it could cause!

Major changes:

•World & Character save implementation

•Support for client patches that add custom races (You should know their DisplayIDs though, not a problem to look up in ChrRaces.dbc);

•Fixed character names not showing up properly (still buggy because it's based on TBC packets probably);

•Many new custom commands;
